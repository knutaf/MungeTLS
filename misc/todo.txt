BUGS:

WORK:
- implement renegotiation
- go through all the code and rearrange order of functions to be more logical for read-through
- change up goto style of main loop

MAYBE:
- functions to advance/reset sequence number
- ability to verify correct cert usages before using
- in parsefrom functions, error path should unset member variables

BY DESIGN:
- don't access MT_VariableLengthField::Data. surface common operations

WON'T FIX:
- think more about thread safety. what are the scenarios, anyway?
