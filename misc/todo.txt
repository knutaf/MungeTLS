BUGS:

WORK:
- watch out for places where we expose an accessor on a base class, such as SymmetricCipherer
- go through all the code and rearrange order of functions to be more logical for read-through
- change up goto style of main loop

MAYBE:
- make internal static for Cipher and Hash return by value instead?
- in parsefrom functions, error path should unset member variables
- GenerateKeyMaterial is just called by computemastersecret
- instead of logging a single flag about whether a record was encrypted, always log the cipher suite used at that time. this could be displayed easily in netmon
- what do we want to do about renegotiations while one is already going on?

BY DESIGN:
- don't access MT_VariableLengthField::Data. surface common operations
- functions to advance/reset sequence number
- ability to verify correct cert usages before using - caller is already picking the certs. they should check it as need be

WON'T FIX:
- think more about thread safety. what are the scenarios, anyway?
- try to replace MT_Securable's accessor with a proper accessor - requires a shared_ptr to be used here
  - same with MT_ConnectionAware

NO REPRO:
- crash in IE when doing repeated renegotiations
