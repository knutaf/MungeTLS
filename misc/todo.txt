BUGS:
- assert when hitting a<enter> in openssl test

WORK:
- customizable behavior for extensions. shouldn't just hard-code reneg info
- implement renegotiation
- configurable behavior about whether to encapsulate multiple handshake messages with a new plaintext message each, or to bundle them in one
- ability to verify correct cert usages before using
- interface for specifying the cert to use
- HandshakeType should be a regular accessor
- proper consts for all magic numbers
- remove the cast operator from MT_CipherSuite to CipherSuiteValue
- don't access MT_VariableLengthField::Data. surface common operations
- support null encryption
- separate RO and RW accessors
- runtime customizable cipher suite
- make all ParseFromPriv and SerializePriv actually private
- support alerts
- put an actual web server on this
