- add a check that ParseFrom is not called multiple times
- customizable behavior for extensions. shouldn't just hard-code reneg info
- configurable behavior about whether to encapsulate multiple handshake messages with a new plaintext message each, or to bundle them in one
- ability to verify correct cert usages before using
- HandshakeType should be a regular accessor
- use a state machine for the handle message stuff
- proper consts for all magic numbers
DONE - renegotiation info
- remove the cast operator from MT_CipherSuite to CipherSuiteValue
- figure out what cipher and hash suites we actually support. there are many places where we seem to support a hash type, but in another place we throw unsupported hash for it
- can all of the hash and cipher related functions around tlsconnection be made const?
- don't access MT_VariableLengthField::Data. surface common operations
- RespondTo should use MT_Structure, not TLSPlaintext
- some kind of abstraction for MT_TLSPlaintext and MT_TLSCiphertext, since they have essentially the same structure

Finish message:
DONE - compute master secret from premaster secret
DONE - generate client write mac, server write mac, client write key, and server write key
- add Finish message structure
- translation of TLSCiphertext to TLSPlaintext
- translation of TLSPlaintext to TLSCiphertext
- compute hash of all handshake messages
