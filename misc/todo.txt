- add a check that ParseFrom is not called multiple times
- customizable behavior for extensions. shouldn't just hard-code reneg info
- configurable behavior about whether to encapsulate multiple handshake messages with a new plaintext message each, or to bundle them in one
- ability to verify correct cert usages before using
- HandshakeType should be a regular accessor
- proper consts for all magic numbers
- remove the cast operator from MT_CipherSuite to CipherSuiteValue
- figure out what cipher and hash suites we actually support. there are many places where we seem to support a hash type, but in another place we throw unsupported hash for it
- don't access MT_VariableLengthField::Data. surface common operations
- support null encryption
