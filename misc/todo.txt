BUGS:
- sometimes we get a random decryption failure. type 9 characters
- tls 1.2 openssl doesn't renegotiate properly, but only when using MTCS_TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA

WORK:
- TLS CLIENT
  - if we have our own client impl, we can also implement some wonky compression scheme
- change up goto style of main loop
- support cached sessions with SessionIDs
- move a bunch of code into a platform-specific lib
  - potentially templatize safe conversion and subsitution?
  - CHKWIN should be renamed
  - remove #include windows.h when possible
- move all templated code into -inl.h files
- move resizevector and other non-TLSey things into mtls_helper.h, extern in other libs

MAYBE:
- instead of logging a single flag about whether a record was encrypted, always log the cipher suite used at that time. this could be displayed easily in netmon
- what do we want to do about renegotiations while one is already going on?










BY DESIGN:
- don't access MT_VariableLengthField::Data. surface common operations
- functions to advance/reset sequence number
- ability to verify correct cert usages before using - caller is already picking the certs. they should check it as need be
- GenerateKeyMaterial is just called by computemastersecret - seems fine. what's the problem?
- make internal static for Cipher and Hash return by value instead? fine as is
- rethink const-ness of encryption and decryption. not all things are modifying cipherer state, are they? - we'll leave it as is

WON'T FIX:
- think more about thread safety. what are the scenarios, anyway?
- try to replace MT_Securable's accessor with a proper accessor - requires a shared_ptr to be used here
  - same with MT_ConnectionAware
- in parsefrom functions, error path should unset member variables - these errors just bubble up anyway, and the caller shouldn't use the object if parse fails

NO REPRO:
- crash in IE when doing repeated renegotiations
