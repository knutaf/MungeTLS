BUGS:

WORK:
- implement renegotiation
- ability to verify correct cert usages before using
- don't access MT_VariableLengthField::Data. surface common operations
- use error and done labels in all functions, not just goto error
- go through all the code and rearrange order of functions to be more logical for read-through
- think more about thread safety. what are the scenarios, anyway?
- functions to advance/reset sequence number. maybe?
- change up goto style of main loop
- maybe: in parsefrom functions, error path should unset member variables
