BUGS:

WORK:
- customizable behavior for extensions. shouldn't just hard-code reneg info
- implement renegotiation
- configurable behavior about whether to encapsulate multiple handshake messages with a new plaintext message each, or to bundle them in one
- ability to verify correct cert usages before using
- platform agnostic method of specifying certificate - what format?
- proper consts for all magic numbers
- remove the cast operator from MT_CipherSuite to CipherSuiteValue
- don't access MT_VariableLengthField::Data. surface common operations
- support null encryption
- runtime customizable cipher suite
- change all printfs to wprintf
- consider replacing the whole protocol version class with just the enum
- use error and done labels in all functions, not just goto error
- go through all the code and rearrange order of functions to be more logical for read-through
- think more about thread safety. what are the scenarios, anyway?
- respondto* parameters are bad
- functions to advance/reset sequence number
- change up goto style of main loop
