BUGS:
- crash in IE when doing repeated renegotiations
- workaround chrome bug with mismatched TLS version in clienthello

WORK:
- watch out for places where we expose an accessor on a base class, such as SymmetricCipherer
- refactor contents of tlscon Initialize
- go through all the code and rearrange order of functions to be more logical for read-through
- change up goto style of main loop
- log decrypted traffic with a flag for munge2netmon to find
- try to replace MT_Securable's accessor with a proper accessor
  - same with MT_ConnectionAware

MAYBE:
- make internal static for Cipher and Hash return by value instead?
- public key encrypted structure should keep a shared_ptr, not a real one?
- functions to advance/reset sequence number
- ability to verify correct cert usages before using
- in parsefrom functions, error path should unset member variables
- GenerateKeyMaterial is just called by computemastersecret

BY DESIGN:
- don't access MT_VariableLengthField::Data. surface common operations

WON'T FIX:
- think more about thread safety. what are the scenarios, anyway?
